# Installation

## Booting from the USB

Press `F12` during the splash screen, select your USB from the list and press enter. You can also keep pressing `Enter` during the Lenovo splash screen and press `F12` while on the selection menu.

## Starting the installer

The installer will do some work (you will see many lines of white text on the blue background). If there are any issues with your hardware, there will probably be some information along the lines.

When the installer finishes its job, you will be prompted with a welcome text and some options. Type `I` for install and press `Enter`.

## Choosing keyboard layout

First, you will be prompted for a keyboard layout. If you know what it is, just type it. If not, type the question mark `?` and confirm with `Enter`.
Now, find a suitable layout from available layouts list and type it in. You can also just confirm without typing anything for a default choice if you're not sure what to choose.
