# Thinkpad T480 Open BSD installation, configuration & management

![](readme.png)

This "book" covers the process of installing & configuring the OpenBSD on Thinkpad T480 laptop (and probably other Thinkpads & laptops as well).
[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) is a secure, UNIX-like operating system with a clean codebase which makes it perfect for minimalists & perfectionists.

I will try to provide simple steps to configure a productive workstation for programming and dive deeper on interesting topics along.
Feel free to contribute if you find a typo, misleading information or just have something important to add.
