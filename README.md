### DISCLAIMER

Even though I am fairly experienced with programming and computers overall, I am not pretending to be any kind of expert.
I've just decided to write down my journey of getting to know OpenBSD better as a reference for a future refreshment.
I will write down steps I've taken to configure a productive workstation for programming and maybe dive deeper on interesting topics along.

Feel free to contribute if you find a typo, misleading information or just have something important to add.
You can be mean to me, but please take my life motto into a consideration:
