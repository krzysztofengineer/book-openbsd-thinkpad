### DISCLAIMER

Even though I am fairly experienced with programming and computers overall, I am not pretending to be any kind of expert.
I've decided to write down about my journey of getting to know OpenBSD better and use it as a reference for a future refreshment.

Feel free to contribute if you find a typo, misleading information or just have something important to add.
You can be mean to me, but please consider my life philosophy:

>  Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever.
