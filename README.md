### DISCLAIMER

Even though I am fairly experienced with programming and computers overall, I am not pretending to be any kind of expert.
I've decided to write down about my journey of getting to know OpenBSD better and use it as a reference for a future refreshment.

Feel free to contribute if you find a typo, misleading information or just have something important to add.
You can be mean to me, but please consider my life philosophy:

### FAQ

- **Do you even know English?**

  I know that my language is bad sometimes, but I hope the key points are easy to understand. 
  If you're superior to me, please consider PR to fix any communication issues.
  
- **Do you know anything about computers?**
  
  I've spent most of my life learning new programming languages (way too many), reinstalling Linux distros and starting new projects that I've abandoned a week later.
  Still, due to my not so great memory, I'm not claiming to be an expert, just sharing what I know to be right at the moment.
